# Reitaku Campus Map Project

This initiative is to create an interactive web map for Reitaku University. It is to be built by 2024 Yoh-Zemi members in the Engineering Department. The plan is to use the MapboxGL javascript library for the interactive map, and Google Sheets API for the data. Regular photos, along with 360 and panoramic images will be incorporated to each location on campus.
